# Traffic Light Control System

This project is aimed at optimizing traffic light control and reducing power consumption in low-traffic areas. Using infrared (IR) sensors, the system detects the presence of vehicles on the road. When vehicles are detected, an 8051 microcontroller is employed to control the traffic lights, effectively turning them on or off as needed.

## Project Objectives:

The key objectives of this project include:

- Utilizing IR sensors to detect the presence of vehicles on the road.

- Employing an 8051 microcontroller to intelligently control the traffic lights.

- Achieving energy savings by turning off unnecessary traffic lights in low-traffic areas.

This project was developed as part of my Microprocessors and Microcontrollers course. It highlights my proficiency in microcontroller programming and hardware integration for efficient traffic management.

By implementing this system, we can not only improve traffic flow but also conserve energy in areas with limited vehicle movement.
